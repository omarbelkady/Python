## Terminology and Techniques


- Clustering: Putting data together which have similar characteristics into dense cluster in an unsupervised way

### Types of Algo in Clustering:
- K Means Clustering
- Hierarchial Clustering
- DBSCAN Clustering
- Expectation Maximization Clustering

### Optimization in ML

- Find the ideal model weights which reduces the loss between predicted and actual value
- whilst remembering to obtain the best fit of a certain dataset to the model  


### Cross-Validation:
- Gives you the performance of your ML model depending on the new unseen data

### Functions You Must Know in Each Category of ML

#### Classification

1. Log
2. Hinge
3. Exponential
4. Cross Entropy
5. Kullback Leibler Divergence

#### Regression

1. Huber, , , , Mean Squared Error/ L2, Mean Squared Logarithm Error/ L2,
2. Quantile
3. Log Cosh
4. Mean Absolute Error/ L1
5. Mean Squared Error/ L2
6. Mean Squared Logarithm Error/ L2
