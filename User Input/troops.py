#Data Types in Python

#str which is a string e.g. "Troops"

#int which is an integer e.g. 5

#float  which is a number with a floating point  e.g. '45.41112'

#complex which is written in standard form a+bi e.g. 6+4j

#list which is an array that holds value and can be changed and you can store any type of data in it  e.g. [1,2,3,4,"bla",5.45, 'a', true]

#tuples which is similar to an array has values stored but they cannot be changed e.g. (6,7,8,9,1,2,3)

#dictionary is a data type which stores keys and a value. I will use a dictionary to map majors by abbreviations e.g. {"cs":"Computer Science", "otto":"Othman", "ce": "Computer Engineering", "apt": "Apartment", "dept":"Department"}
